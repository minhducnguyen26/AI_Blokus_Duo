This project involves the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve the game of Blokus Duo. Blokus Duo is a two-player game in which each player tries to place as many of their pieces on the board as possible while blocking their opponent from doing the same. The AI will use the Minimax algorithm to determine the best possible moves to make based on the current state of the game.

The Minimax algorithm is a commonly used algorithm in game theory and AI. It works by searching through all possible moves that can be made by both players and assigning a score to each potential outcome. The algorithm then chooses the move that leads to the highest score for the player, while assuming that the opponent will choose their best move to minimize the player's score. This approach ensures that the AI will make the most optimal move possible given the current state of the game.
